# Covid Rates and Counts in Washington State

## [Map 1](https://github.com/NobuLNL/WashingtonCovid19Cases/blob/1fd955b0508f11cb8c1034165c5201069040a58b/map1.html)

Map 1 is a chloropleth map of the different counties in Washington state and the Covid-19 rates that were experienced by each county.
These rates are calculated by taking the amount of Covid-19 cases in the county and dividing them by the population proportionally
to create a resulting rate of how many cases there were per 1000 people. This eliminates some of the factors of the differences
between more densely populated areas having many more cases than counties of lower population. A theme from mapbox.gl was used as well as
maps from openstreetmap. The data that was collected for the purpose of this map was collected from a New York Times collection of data
that spread across America but I chose to focus in on Washington State.

## [Map 2](https://github.com/NobuLNL/WashingtonCovid19Cases/blob/1fd955b0508f11cb8c1034165c5201069040a58b/map2.html)

Map 2 is a proportional symbol map that uses a database also taken from the New York Times data repository and it shows the count of Cases in
Washington State for Covid-19 with no calculations having to be done the proportional symbols represent the number of cases in each county with
the color as well as the size of the bubble changing with more or less cases. Because there is no calculation to account for higher or lower populations.
You will notice that the bubbles for areas such as King, Spokane and Pierce county are much higher of that than other more rural areas.
